# UFOs: The Truth is Out There

## Overview of Project
This site allows for in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, the table can be filtered by city, state, country, shape, or a combination of the previous.

## Results
To filter the web page, click into one of the boxes under the filter search heading as seen below.

As an example, we will start with filtering the table to 1/12/2010 as a date, then clicking out of the date box.

To add another layer, just click into the box and type what you are looking for, then click out of the box. In this example, we added a state filter on top of the date filter.

To refresh the filters, either remove the text previously entered and click out of the box, or refresh the web browser. 

## Summary
Adding the ability to filter by multiple criteria is very helpful when looking for something specific, but can be limiting at the same time as you are no longer able to scroll through the entire table. I would reccommend adding a date range instead of a single date filter, thay way you could look at the other filters over a period if time, like a month or year, to look for patterns. It might also be nice to have suggestions or drop downs so that the user knows what the limitations of the table are. For example, it would be nice to see what shapes are available instead of just picking one from memory.
